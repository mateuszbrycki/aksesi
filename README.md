["Get Noticed 2017"](http://dajsiepoznac.pl) project.

###Main idea
 Aksesi's main idea is to allow authenticate user with password which consists of characters and gestures. 
 There will be at least two modules. Front-end written in JavaScript that will be responsible for gathering users actions â€“ pressed keys and drawn gestures. Second application, back-end service, which main responsibility will be password recognition. Back-end will be developed with Spring Framework.
